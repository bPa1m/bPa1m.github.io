# A dive into Face to Face, a game created for GGJ 2026:

Face to Face is a game I participated in developing for the 2026 Global Game Jam on my University's campus. I worked on Face to Face with 3 of my friends. Here I will go into a little detail about what I helped with in the game jam.

# 3D Assets

My pipeline for the creature production was to  
sculpt -> retopologize -> uv unwrap -> paint textures -> bake textures and normals -> create skeleton -> rig mesh -> animate skeleton  
this allowed me to get a decent level of detail onto a mesh that could be animated

# Programming
Most of my time for this game was spent on the creature and mask assets, but I also handled the programming behind interacting with the monster and the monster's mood. There isn't much behind the scenes that is interesting to talk about here, the monster has a mood variable that changes based on what the player uses when interacting with it and it also decays over time.

I think the most interesting thing about the programming is how the creature's mood was implemented using a state machine. This made it super easy to know when to trigger animations when the creature picks up masks as its mood changes.

# My Reflection
I participated in the game jam as a weekend jam, so I worked over a span of 48 hours to create this game with some of my friends. Coming up with an idea and bringing it fully to life in a few days is the coolest experience. The downside of such a quick turnover is that the final product ends up being janky in some areas and playtesting always brings up crazy or game breaking bugs. All in all a fun experience and a cool concept and I am happy with how it turned out.
