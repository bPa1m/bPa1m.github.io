# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Hello! I am Benjamin Palmieri. I am an Indie Video Game Developer specializing in game design and programming. I enjoy working in all aspects of game developement from writing to 3D modelling to music production. If something is needed to make a game I've probably at least dabbled in it! I am currently enjoying working on my latest game BloodFort, while fitting in the occasional game jam!
